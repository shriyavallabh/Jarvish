Send to 200 clients in 30 seconds, with 98% open rates. ₹999/month - less than one client's monthly SIP. Start your 14-day free trial today."

### 1-Minute Pitch
"Every morning, 275,000 Indian financial advisors face the same challenge - creating compliant content that clients actually read. Email open rates are 20%, but WhatsApp? 98%. 

Jarvish solves this with AI that thinks like Warren Buffett but knows SEBI like a compliance officer. Create a week's content in 2 minutes, send to all clients instantly, track engagement automatically. 

Our three-stage compliance engine ensures zero violations. Pre-approved content library means you never miss a day. Professional branding makes you look like a Fortune 500 advisor.

₹999/month for 100 clients. That's less than what one client pays in mutual fund charges. Join 500+ advisors already using Jarvish. 14-day free trial, no credit card required."

### 3-Minute Pitch
"Let me ask you something - how many hours did you spend last week creating content for clients? The average advisor spends 2.1 hours. That's 109 hours a year - almost three work weeks just on content.

Now imagine this: You wake up, open Jarvish, and see AI-generated content inspired by Warren Buffett's investment philosophy, tailored for Indian investors, and triple-checked for SEBI compliance. You review it in 30 seconds, hit send, and reach all 200 clients on WhatsApp before your morning chai gets cold.

Here's what makes Jarvish different:

First, we're WhatsApp-native. Your clients check WhatsApp 23 times a day. Email? Maybe once. Our content gets 98% open rates and 5x more engagement.

Second, our AI doesn't just generate content - it thinks like a compliance officer. Three-stage validation: hard rules, AI evaluation, final verification. Result? 99.8% compliance accuracy. We're so confident, we cover any penalties.

Third, we understand Indian advisors. Content in Hindi, English, and Marathi. Festival greetings. Market updates in Indian context. Educational content that resonates with your clients' goals - child's education, retirement, first home.

The results speak for themselves:
- Save 2 hours weekly
- 5x increase in client engagement
- 30% more client meetings booked
- Zero compliance violations

Pricing? Three simple tiers:
- Starter at ₹999/month for new advisors
- Growth at ₹2,499/month with branding features
- Premium at ₹4,999/month with unlimited everything

That Premium plan? It costs less than what one client generates in trail commission.

500+ advisors already trust Jarvish. MFDs managing ₹50 lakhs to RIAs managing ₹50 crores. They all say the same thing - 'Why didn't this exist earlier?'

Start your 14-day free trial today. No credit card. No obligations. Just better client relationships from day one."

## 5. OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### "AI will replace the human touch"
**Response**: "Jarvish doesn't replace your expertise - it amplifies it. You still review every message, add personal insights, and maintain client relationships. We just handle the time-consuming compliance checks and content creation. Think of it as hiring Warren Buffett as your content assistant, not your replacement."

### "Too expensive for small advisors"
**Response**: "At ₹999/month, Jarvish costs less than one client's monthly SIP commission. It saves you 8 hours monthly - what's your time worth? Plus, advisors typically see 30% more client meetings after using Jarvish, easily covering the cost. Try our 14-day free trial and calculate the ROI yourself."

### "Compliance issues with AI content"
**Response**: "We understand your concern - one SEBI violation can end careers. That's why we built three-stage validation: hard-coded rules, AI evaluation, and final verification. 99.8% compliance accuracy across 50,000+ messages. We're so confident, we provide full liability coverage for any penalties."

### "My clients don't use WhatsApp"
**Response**: "97% of Indian investors use WhatsApp daily. Even 60+ age group checks it 12 times daily. We also generate content for email and SMS. But here's the truth - if your clients aren't on WhatsApp, you're missing where financial conversations happen today. We'll help you transition smoothly."
