## Identified Gaps

### 1. Missing Sample Files

#### ❌ GAP-001: Missing Marathi Violation Samples
**File**: `/docs/compliance/samples/marathi-violations.md`  
**Severity**: 🟡 LOW PRIORITY  
**Impact**: Minor - Affects compliance testing completeness  
**Status**: Missing

**Description:**
While the compliance samples directory contains comprehensive examples in English and Hindi, the Marathi violation samples file is missing. This creates an incomplete set for testing Stage 1 compliance validation.

**Expected Content:**
- Marathi language compliance violations examples
- Forbidden terms in Marathi script (Devanagari)
- Risk scoring test cases for Marathi content
- Regex pattern validation samples

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Development Blocking**: No - Development can proceed
- **Testing Impact**: Minor - Marathi compliance testing may be incomplete initially
- **Business Risk**: Low - English and Hindi coverage sufficient for initial launch

**Remediation:**
Create `/docs/compliance/samples/marathi-violations.md` with structure matching:
- `english-violations.md` (reference template)
- `hindi-violations.md` (language pattern reference)
- Include Marathi forbidden terms from `rules/regex-gates.md`

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
