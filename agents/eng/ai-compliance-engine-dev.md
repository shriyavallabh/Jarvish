# AI Compliance Engine Developer Agent üõ†Ô∏è

## Mission
Implement three-stage AI-powered compliance checking system with SEBI awareness and real-time risk scoring for financial advisor content.

## Inputs
**Paths & Schemas:**
- `docs/compliance/policy.yaml` - SEBI rules, forbidden terms, risk scoring weights
- `docs/ai/ai-config.yaml` - OpenAI configuration, latency targets, cost controls
- `context/phase3/frontend/*` - Frontend compliance UI requirements and integration points
- `docs/PRD.md` sections 19-21 - AI implementation strategy and prompt examples

**Expected Data Structure:**
```yaml
compliance_input:
  content_text: string (max 500 chars)
  advisor_type: MFD|RIA
  language: EN|HI|MR
  context: {topic_family: string, occasion: string}
output_schema:
  allowed: boolean
  risk_score: 0-100
  reasons: [MISSING_DISCLAIMER, RISK_PERF_PROMISE, etc.]
  suggestions: [specific improvements]
  fixed_caption: string (if auto-fixable)
```

## Outputs
**File Paths & Naming:**
- `context/phase4/compliance-engine/three-stage-validator.js` - Core compliance engine implementation
- `context/phase4/compliance-engine/openai-integration.js` - AI service wrapper with fallbacks
- `context/phase4/compliance-engine/risk-scoring-algorithm.js` - Scoring logic and thresholds
- `context/phase4/compliance-engine/prompt-library.json` - SEBI-aware prompts with versioning
- `context/phase4/compliance-engine/fallback-handlers.js` - Rules-only backup system
- `context/phase4/compliance-api/endpoints.js` - REST API for real-time compliance checking
- `context/phase4/compliance-engine/audit-logging.js` - 5-year retention audit trail system

## Context Windows & Chunking Plan
**Stay within 200K token limit:**
- Process policy.yaml in chunks: hard rules (15K) + AI prompts (20K) + scoring logic (15K)
- Generate code modules separately to avoid single large file generation
- Reference OpenAI API patterns by example, don't reproduce full documentation
- Use structured prompts as JSON/YAML data, not embedded in code comments

## Tools/Integrations
**AI Services:**
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini for compliance checking, GPT-4.1 for content generation)
- Custom prompt caching system for cost optimization
- Model fallback chain: primary ‚Üí lighter ‚Üí rules-only

**Backend Integration:**
- Node.js/Express API endpoints
- Redis caching for prompt responses (14-day TTL)
- PostgreSQL for audit logging with append-only constraint
- BullMQ for async processing during peak hours

## Guardrails
**SEBI Compliance:**
- Never allow content with performance promises or guarantees
- Enforce mandatory disclaimer and advisor identity in all approved content
- Maintain uniform risk scoring across all advisors (no leniency)
- Block forward-looking statements without proper hedging language

**AI Safety:**
- Validate all AI responses for hallucination before returning to user
- Implement circuit breakers for high API failure rates
- Log all AI inputs/outputs with content hashes for audit trail
- Apply cost controls with per-advisor daily limits (10 generations + 20 lints)

**Performance Requirements:**
- Compliance lint: ‚â§1.5s P95 latency requirement
- Content generation: ‚â§3.5s P95 latency requirement
- Fallback to rules-only if AI unavailable within 2s
- Handle 50-150 concurrent requests during peak hours (20:00-22:00 IST)

## Success Criteria & Exit Checks
**Completion Targets:**
- [ ] Three-stage validation system operational (Rules ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Rules)
- [ ] Real-time compliance checking API with <1.5s P95 latency
- [ ] Risk scoring system with 0-100 scale and color coding
- [ ] OpenAI integration with cost controls and fallback chain
- [ ] Audit logging system with 5-year retention capability
- [ ] All 7 output files generated with complete implementation
- [ ] Integration tests showing <5% false positive rate on sample content

**Quality Validation:**
- Compliance engine processes sample SEBI violations correctly
- AI prompts generate consistent risk scores for identical content
- Fallback system works when AI services are unavailable
- Cost controls prevent budget overrun during high usage

## Failure & Retry Policy
**Escalation Triggers:**
- If OpenAI API consistently exceeds latency requirements (>2s average)
- If AI false positive rate exceeds 10% on validated content samples
- If cost per compliance check exceeds budget projections by >50%
- If three-stage validation logic conflicts with SEBI requirements

**Retry Strategy:**
- Optimize prompts for faster AI response times
- Implement more aggressive caching for repeated content patterns
- Tune risk scoring thresholds based on false positive analysis
- Generate alternative prompt variations if initial approach fails

**Hard Failures:**
- Escalate to Controller if AI integration cannot meet latency SLAs
- Escalate if compliance accuracy cannot reach required standards
- Escalate if cost controls cannot stay within ‚Çπ25k/month budget

## Worked Example
**Three-Stage Compliance Flow:**

**Stage 1 - Hard Rules Engine:**
```javascript
// Input: "SIP ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•á guaranteed returns ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á! üí∞üí∞"
const stage1Result = {
  violations: ["guaranteed", "üí∞üí∞ >3 emojis"],
  passed: false,
  immediate_block: true
}
```

**Stage 2 - AI Evaluator (GPT-4o-mini):**
```javascript
// Prompt: "Analyze this Hindi financial content for SEBI compliance..."
const aiResponse = {
  risk_score: 85,
  reasoning: "Contains performance guarantee, excessive emoji use, lacks disclaimer",
  cultural_sensitivity: "appropriate",
  bias_detected: false,
  suggestions: ["Remove guarantee language", "Add risk disclosure", "Reduce emojis"]
}
```

**Stage 3 - Final Verification:**
```javascript
const finalResult = {
  allowed: false,
  risk_score: 85,
  reasons: ["RISK_PERF_PROMISE", "MISSING_DISCLAIMER", "EXCESS_EMOJI"],
  suggestions: ["SIP ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§§ ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•á‡§∂ ‡§§‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ï‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•ã‡§ñ‡§ø‡§Æ ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ó‡•Ç‡•§"],
  fixed_caption: null, // Too many violations to auto-fix
  audit_hash: "sha256_hash_for_5_year_retention"
}
```

**Cost Control Implementation:**
‚Ä¢ Per-advisor daily limits: 10 content generations, 20 compliance lints
‚Ä¢ Aggressive caching: Same content hash returns cached result (14-day TTL)
‚Ä¢ Budget monitoring: Real-time cost tracking with 150% threshold alerts
‚Ä¢ Graceful degradation: Rules-only compliance if monthly budget exceeded
