# Task Completion Sound Notifications Setup
## Automatic Sound Alerts for Terminal Commands

---

## ✅ WHAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED

I've successfully set up a comprehensive sound notification system that plays audio alerts when terminal commands complete. This works across all terminals and is fully integrated with your shell environment.

### Components Created:

1. **Sound Playback Script** (`scripts/play-completion-sound.sh`)
   - Plays macOS system sounds
   - Configurable sound selection
   - Fallback to terminal bell

2. **Shell Integration Hook** (`scripts/shell-sound-hook.sh`)
   - Automatic command timing
   - Plays sound for commands >3 seconds
   - Different sounds for success/failure
   - Works with both bash and zsh

3. **Global Shell Configuration** (Updated `.zshrc`)
   - Automatically loads sound hooks
   - Applies to all new terminal sessions
   - Persistent across system restarts

4. **Claude Code Integration** (`.claude/hooks/task-completion-sound.json`)
   - Plays sounds after Claude Code operations
   - Triggers on Write, Edit, Bash commands

5. **Test Suite** (`scripts/test-sound-hooks.sh`)
   - Verifies all components working
   - Tests different sound options
   - Provides setup instructions

## 🎵 HOW IT WORKS

### Automatic Triggers:
- **Terminal Commands**: Any command taking >3 seconds triggers a sound
- **Success Sound**: "Glass" sound for successful commands (exit code 0)
- **Error Sound**: "Basso" sound for failed commands (non-zero exit code)
- **Claude Code**: Sounds play after file operations and bash commands

### Available Sounds (macOS):
- Glass (default success)
- Basso (default error)
- Ping, Pop, Hero, Funk
- Blow, Bottle, Frog
- Morse, Purr, Sosumi
- Submarine, Tink

## 🚀 HOW TO USE

### For New Terminal Windows:
The sound system is **automatically active** in all new terminal windows. Just open a new terminal and run any command that takes >3 seconds.

### For Current Terminal:
```bash
source ~/Desktop/Jarvish/scripts/shell-sound-hook.sh
```

### Control Commands:
```bash
# Disable sounds temporarily
disable_task_sounds

# Enable sounds again
enable_task_sounds

# Change the success sound
set_task_sound Ping

# Change the error sound
export TASK_SOUND_NAME=Hero

# Adjust minimum duration (default 3 seconds)
export TASK_SOUND_MIN_DURATION=5
```

---

## 🧪 TESTING

### Quick Test:
```bash
# This will play a sound after 4 seconds
sleep 4 && echo "Sound should play now!"

# This will play an error sound
sleep 4 && false

# This won't play a sound (too quick)
echo "Too fast for sound"
```

### Run Full Test Suite:
```bash
~/Desktop/Jarvish/scripts/test-sound-hooks.sh
```

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### Environment Variables:
```bash
# Enable/disable sounds (default: true)
export TASK_SOUND_ENABLED=true

# Sound for successful commands (default: Glass)
export TASK_SOUND_NAME=Glass

# Minimum command duration in seconds (default: 3)
export TASK_SOUND_MIN_DURATION=3
```

### Make Permanent:
Add any of the above exports to your `~/.zshrc` file to make them permanent.

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Sounds Not Playing:
1. Check volume is not muted
2. Verify in new terminal: `echo $TASK_SOUND_ENABLED`
3. Test directly: `~/Desktop/Jarvish/scripts/play-completion-sound.sh`
4. Check sound file exists: `ls /System/Library/Sounds/`

### Too Many/Few Sounds:
- Increase minimum duration: `export TASK_SOUND_MIN_DURATION=10`
- Disable for current session: `disable_task_sounds`

### Different Shell (bash):
The system also works with bash, but you may need to install `bash-preexec`:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec/master/bash-preexec.sh -o ~/.bash-preexec.sh
echo '[[ -f ~/.bash-preexec.sh ]] && source ~/.bash-preexec.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```
