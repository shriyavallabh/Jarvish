## Final GO/NO-GO Recommendation with Critical Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### **RECOMMENDATION: CONDITIONAL GO**
**Confidence Level: 72%**

Jarvish presents a viable market opportunity in the Indian financial advisory space, but success depends on careful execution and strategic positioning. The market shows genuine demand for content automation solutions, with advisors spending 2.1 hours/week on marketing and 85% finding it difficult. However, several critical assumptions require validation through a controlled pilot before full-scale launch.

## 1. MARKET SIZE REALITY CHECK

### Claimed vs Actual Addressable Market

#### **Total Market Claims**
- **Claimed**: 275,000 MFDs (per PRD and research)
- **Reality**: 275,000 EUIN holders exist, BUT:
  - Only ~150,000 (55%) are actively engaged
  - ~132,000 struggle with differentiation
  - ~40,000 are tech-savvy enough for SaaS adoption

#### **Actual Addressable Market (TAM/SAM/SOM)**
```
TAM (Total Addressable Market):
- 150,000 active MFDs + 1,000 RIAs = 151,000 advisors
- At ₹3,000 avg monthly spend = ₹453 Cr annual TAM

SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):
- 40% tech-ready = 60,400 advisors
- Focus on top 6 cities initially = 30,000 advisors
- Annual SAM = ₹90 Cr

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market - 3 years):
- Realistic capture: 5% of SAM = 1,500 advisors
- At ₹2,999 average price = ₹54 Lakhs MRR
- Annual SOM = ₹6.48 Cr
```

**Validation**: Market exists but is 60% smaller than initial assumptions
