```yaml
quality_rating_based_limits:
  high_quality_rating:
    tier_1: "1,000 unique recipients in 24 hours"

    execution_precision: "millisecond_accurate_scheduling"
    
  example_implementation: |
    def calculate_delivery_time(advisor_id, base_time):
        group = hash(advisor_id) % 4
        jitter_start = base_time + (group * 30)  # 30 second group offset
        jitter_range = 60  # 60 second window per group
        random_offset = secure_random(0, jitter_range)
