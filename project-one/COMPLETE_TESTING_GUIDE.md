## 🛡️ **2. AI COMPLIANCE ENGINE** (Core Innovation)

### **How the AI Engine Works:**

#### **Stage 1: Basic Rules** (< 5ms)
```javascript
// Test with these phrases:
"Guaranteed returns of 15%" // ❌ VIOLATION
"Risk-free investment"       // ❌ VIOLATION  
"Market-linked returns"      // ✅ COMPLIANT
```

#### **Stage 2: SEBI Compliance** (< 50ms)
```javascript
// Required elements check:
✅ Risk disclaimer present
✅ Past performance warning
✅ Advisor identification
✅ Educational framing
```

#### **Stage 3: AI Analysis** (< 400ms)
```javascript
// Semantic understanding:
✅ Context appropriateness

✅ Risk scoring algorithm
```

### **Live AI Testing:**
```bash
# Test API directly:
