## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Token Budget Guidelines
- **PRD Analysis**: 15K tokens (focus on advisor personas and workflows)
- **Compliance Integration**: 12K tokens (SEBI rule mapping to UX patterns)  
- **Workflow Generation**: 18K tokens (detailed user journey documentation)
- **Mobile & Integration**: 15K tokens (responsive and WhatsApp flow design)
- **Buffer**: 20K tokens for iteration and refinement

### File Processing Strategy
- Process PRD in sections: personas (15K) + workflows (20K) + compliance (25K)
- Generate wireframes as ASCII art and structured markdown (avoid image descriptions)
- Use progressive disclosure patterns - core flows first, edge cases separately
- Reference compliance docs by section numbers to avoid token waste

### Quality Assurance
- Validate all workflows against advisor personas from PRD
- Ensure compliance patterns match policy.yaml requirements exactly  
- Test mobile usability assumptions against 44px touch target minimums
- Verify AI integration timing aligns with technical constraints from ai-config.yaml
