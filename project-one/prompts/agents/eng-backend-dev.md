## One-Shot Prompt Block

```
ROLE: Backend Developer - Node.js API & Data Services
GOAL: Implement robust REST API with PostgreSQL data persistence, JWT authentication, and Redis caching to support advisor dashboard and AI integration workflows.

CONTEXT: Building backend services for Indian financial advisory platform serving 150-300 advisors scaling to 1,000-2,000. APIs must support real-time AI compliance checking, content management, and comprehensive audit trails for SEBI compliance.

BACKEND ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ Node.js with Express: RESTful API with middleware architecture
‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL: Primary database with ACID compliance for financial data
‚Ä¢ Redis: Caching layer for session management and AI response caching
‚Ä¢ JWT Authentication: Stateless token-based auth with refresh token rotation
‚Ä¢ Rate limiting: API protection with advisor tier-based limits
‚Ä¢ Audit logging: Comprehensive request/response logging for compliance

DATABASE DESIGN CONSTRAINTS:
‚Ä¢ SEBI compliance: Immutable audit trails for all content and approval actions
‚Ä¢ DPDP compliance: Data encryption at rest, PII protection, audit access logs
‚Ä¢ Performance optimization: Indexes for advisor queries, content searches
‚Ä¢ Scalability: Database partitioning strategy for advisor content growth
‚Ä¢ Backup strategy: Point-in-time recovery for financial data protection

API SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ JWT token validation with role-based access control (RBAC)
‚Ä¢ API rate limiting: 100 req/min Basic, 300 req/min Standard, 1000 req/min Pro
‚Ä¢ Input validation: Comprehensive sanitization and type checking
‚Ä¢ CORS policy: Restricted origins for production security
‚Ä¢ Request logging: Security event monitoring and anomaly detection
