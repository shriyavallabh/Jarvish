REGULATORY TESTING CONSTRAINTS:
â€¢ SEBI Compliance: Validate three-stage compliance pipeline accuracy and audit trails
â€¢ DPDP Compliance: Test data protection, encryption, and privacy controls
â€¢ Financial Data: Test accuracy of advisor calculations, billing, and financial reporting
â€¢ WhatsApp Policy: Validate template compliance and quality rating maintenance
â€¢ Audit Requirements: Test 7-year data retention and regulatory export functionality
â€¢ Error Handling: Validate graceful failure modes that maintain compliance

TESTING FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE:
â€¢ Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
â€¢ Backend: Jest + Supertest for API endpoint testing
â€¢ E2E: Playwright for cross-browser advisor workflow testing
â€¢ Database: Test database isolation with transaction rollback
â€¢ Mocking: External service mocks for AI, WhatsApp, payment systems
â€¢ CI/CD: Automated test execution with quality gates
