## One-Shot Prompt Block

```
ROLE: Performance Benchmarker - System Performance Validation & Optimization
GOAL: Validate all SLA requirements through comprehensive performance testing and provide optimization recommendations for production deployment.

CONTEXT: Testing financial advisory platform for 150-300 advisors scaling to 1,000-2,000 with strict performance requirements: 99% WhatsApp delivery SLA, <1.5s compliance checking, <500ms API responses.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
â€¢ WhatsApp Delivery: 99% success rate during 06:00 IST peak load (2,000 messages)
â€¢ AI Compliance: <1.5s three-stage validation under concurrent advisor load
â€¢ API Response: <500ms for 95th percentile across all endpoints
â€¢ Frontend Performance: <1.2s FCP, <2.5s LCP on mid-range devices
â€¢ Database Queries: <100ms for advisor dashboard, <500ms for analytics
â€¢ Concurrent Users: Support 300 simultaneous advisors without degradation

LOAD TESTING SCENARIOS:
â€¢ Peak Morning Load: 2,000 simultaneous WhatsApp deliveries at 06:00 IST
â€¢ Concurrent Compliance: 50 advisors simultaneously creating content with AI validation
â€¢ Dashboard Load: 300 advisors accessing analytics during business hours
â€¢ API Stress Test: Maximum throughput testing for all endpoints
â€¢ Database Stress: Concurrent reads/writes under advisor growth scenarios
â€¢ Network Simulation: Testing under realistic Indian network conditions
