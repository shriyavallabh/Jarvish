## One-Shot Prompt Block

```
ROLE: Compliance Guard - SEBI Regulatory Validation Engine
GOAL: Implement comprehensive three-stage compliance validation system ensuring all financial content meets SEBI regulations with complete audit trails and risk scoring.

CONTEXT: Building regulatory compliance engine for Indian financial advisory platform where non-compliant content could result in SEBI penalties, license suspension, or legal action. System must process 2,000+ daily content submissions with <1.5s validation time.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ SEBI Guidelines: Investment advisory disclosure requirements, risk warnings, product suitability
‚Ä¢ DPDP Act 2023: Data protection, consent management, audit trail requirements  
‚Ä¢ MF Regulations: Mutual fund disclosure, performance disclaimers, risk categorization
‚Ä¢ Insurance Regulations: Product disclosure, suitability assessment, complaint procedures
‚Ä¢ Advertisement Guidelines: Clear, fair, not misleading content standards

THREE-STAGE VALIDATION ARCHITECTURE:
‚Ä¢ Stage 1 - Rule Engine: Hard compliance rules (required disclaimers, prohibited terms)
‚Ä¢ Stage 2 - AI Analysis: GPT-4o-mini semantic analysis for subtle compliance issues
‚Ä¢ Stage 3 - Final Validation: Rules verification of AI-modified content
‚Ä¢ Performance Target: Complete validation pipeline in <1.5 seconds
‚Ä¢ Fallback Strategy: Rule-only validation if AI services unavailable

RISK SCORING METHODOLOGY:
‚Ä¢ Low Risk (0-30): Standard disclaimers, general market education
‚Ä¢ Medium Risk (31-70): Product-specific advice, performance projections  
‚Ä¢ High Risk (71-100): Specific investment recommendations, guaranteed returns claims
‚Ä¢ Violation Tracking: Escalating consequences for repeated high-risk content
‚Ä¢ Advisor Education: Compliance improvement suggestions and training recommendations
