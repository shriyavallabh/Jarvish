- Performance targets met (FCP < 1.2s, LCP < 2.5s)

**Branch Options**:
- **Continue to Phase 4**: Frontend complete, AI integration stable
- **Return to Phase 2**: Design system gaps affecting implementation
- **Staged Backend Integration**: Begin Phase 4 with working frontend prototype
- **Performance Optimization**: Address speed issues before backend integration

### Phase 4 Checkpoint: Backend Services & AI-First Architecture Complete
**Duration**: 21-28 days
**Trigger**: All backend services integrated, 99% delivery SLA achieved, compliance validation complete

**Final Validation Criteria**:
- **Delivery SLA**: ≥99% WhatsApp messages delivered by 06:05 IST
- **Compliance Engine**: Three-stage validation system operational with <5% false positives
- **AI Performance**: Lint ≤1.5s P95, Generation ≤3.5s P95 consistently achieved
- **SEBI Compliance**: All content meets regulatory requirements, audit framework functional
- **DPDP Compliance**: Data protection measures implemented, DSAR workflows operational
- **Fallback System**: Pre-approved content library functional, automatic assignment working
- **Analytics**: Advisor performance insights generated, churn risk detection operational

**Production Readiness Gates**:
- **Security**: Penetration testing passed, encryption at-rest implemented
- **Performance**: Load testing validates 2,000 advisor capacity
- **Compliance**: SEBI audit framework generates required reports
- **Monitoring**: Datadog APM operational, alerting configured for SLA violations
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO ≤60min, RPO ≤15min validated through testing

**Branch Options**:
- **Production Deployment**: All criteria met, begin advisor onboarding
- **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to pilot group of 10-20 friendly advisors
- **Performance Iteration**: Address scalability issues with limited advisor group
- **Compliance Review**: Additional regulatory validation required

## Rewind Conditions & Recovery Strategies

### Critical UX/Compliance Flaw (Any Phase → Phase 1)
**Triggers**:
- Fundamental compliance workflow broken
- Advisor user experience creates regulatory risk
- SEBI/DPDP requirements misunderstood

**Recovery**: Return to Phase 1 with compliance expert consultation

### AI Integration Failure (Phase 3/4 → Phase 2)
**Triggers**:
- AI latency consistently >2x targets
- Compliance engine false positive rate >20%
- OpenAI integration unreliable

**Recovery**: Redesign AI integration patterns, potentially reduce AI dependency

### WhatsApp Policy Violation (Phase 4 → Phase 3)
**Triggers**:
- Template rejections from Meta
- Quality rating drop to Medium/Low
- Mass advisor opt-outs

**Recovery**: Revise WhatsApp integration strategy, adjust templates and messaging

### Performance SLA Miss (Phase 4 → Phase 3)
**Triggers**:
- Delivery SLA <95% for 3 consecutive days
- Dashboard response times >2s P95
- AI processing queue backing up

**Recovery**: Performance optimization iteration, potentially architectural changes

## Checkpoint Automation

### Automated Validation
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript compilation, ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing**: Unit test coverage >80%, integration tests passing
- **Performance**: Lighthouse scores, bundle size analysis
- **Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning, SAST analysis
- **Compliance**: Automated SEBI disclaimer validation, PII detection

### Manual Validation Required
- **UX Testing**: Advisor feedback sessions, usability validation
- **Compliance Review**: Legal/regulatory expert sign-off
- **Security Review**: Penetration testing results, architecture review
- **Business Validation**: Metrics alignment with business objectives

### Checkpoint Documentation
Each checkpoint generates:
- **Technical Report**: Performance metrics, test results, code quality
- **Business Report**: Feature completeness, user acceptance, compliance status
- **Risk Assessment**: Known issues, mitigation strategies, rollback procedures
- **Next Phase Plan**: Updated timeline, resource requirements, dependencies
