## üîß Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Run migrations
npm run prisma:migrate deploy

# Seed initial data
npm run seed
```

### 2. Build Applications
```bash
# Build backend
cd apps/backend
npm run build

# Build frontend
cd apps/web
npm run build
```

### 3. Deploy Backend
```bash
# Using PM2 for process management
pm2 start dist/simple-server.js --name jarvish-backend
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### 4. Deploy Frontend
```bash
# Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
vercel --prod
# OR
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 5. Configure WhatsApp Webhook
```bash
# Register webhook URL
curl -X POST https://graph.facebook.com/v17.0/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d "webhook_url=https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/whatsapp"
```

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Health Checks
- [ ] `/health` endpoint responding
- [ ] `/api/monitoring/health` showing all services healthy
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] Redis cache operational
- [ ] WhatsApp API connected

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Response times < 1.5s for compliance checks
- [ ] WhatsApp delivery rate > 99%

## üö® Rollback Plan

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Application crash rate > 1%
- Response time > 3s for 5 minutes
- Error rate > 5%
- Memory usage > 90%

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. Switch load balancer to previous version
2. Restore database from backup if needed
3. Clear Redis cache
4. Notify team via Slack/Discord
5. Investigate root cause
