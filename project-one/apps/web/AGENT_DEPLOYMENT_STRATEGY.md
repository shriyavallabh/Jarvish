  week7: ["Analytics Agent", "Mobile Agent"];
  week10: ["API Agent", "Security Agent"];
}
```

## Success Validation Framework

### Phase Gate Reviews
Each phase requires agent deliverable validation:

1. **Code Quality**: Automated testing coverage >80%
2. **Performance**: Meeting specified latency requirements
3. **Integration**: Successful handoff to next agent
4. **Documentation**: Complete technical specifications
5. **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities

### Final Integration Testing
```typescript
interface IntegrationTests {
  endToEnd: {
    userJourney: "Payment → Login → Content View";
    adminJourney: "Create → Approve → Distribute";
    systemFlow: "Scrape → Generate → Validate → Deliver";
  };
  performance: {
    load: "1000 concurrent users";
    distribution: "1000 messages in 5 minutes";
    response: "<200ms API calls";
  };
  reliability: {
    uptime: "99.9% over 7 days";
    delivery: "99% success rate";
    payment: "95% transaction success";
  };
}
```

This agent deployment strategy ensures efficient development through specialized expertise while maintaining integration quality and meeting aggressive timeline requirements for the content distribution platform.
