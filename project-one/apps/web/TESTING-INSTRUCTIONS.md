# üß™ Jarvish Testing Instructions

## Current Status & Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Issues Fixed:
1. **Profile Save Error**: Fixed the `/api/onboarding/complete` endpoint to actually save data to the database
2. **Authentication Flow**: Updated to work with mock database
3. **Advisor Dashboard**: Now uses mock hooks that work with the local database
4. **Form Display**: Dashboard correctly checks for advisor profile and redirects to onboarding if needed

## üìã Testing Flow

### Option 1: Fresh Sign Up (Recommended)
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. Sign up with a NEW email (not the test credentials)
4. Complete the onboarding form with these fields:
   - Full Name: Your Name
   - Phone: +919876543210
   - Business Name: Test Financial Advisors
   - City: Mumbai (required)
   - State: Maharashtra (required)
   - Other fields are optional
5. Click "Complete Setup"
6. You'll be redirected to the advisor dashboard

### Option 2: Using Existing Sign In
If you're already signed in and seeing the onboarding form:
1. Fill out the form completely (especially required fields marked with *)
2. Click "Complete Setup"
3. The profile will now save correctly to the database

### Option 3: Reset and Start Fresh
```bash
# Clear Clerk session
# 1. Sign out from the app
# 2. Clear browser cookies for localhost:3000
# 3. Start fresh with Option 1
```

## üîç What Was Happening

### The Problems:
1. **"Failed to save profile" error**: The API endpoint had database save code commented out (TODO comment)
2. **Advisor dashboard showing form**: The dashboard checks for an advisor profile in the database. If none exists, it redirects to onboarding
3. **"Already signed in" message**: Clerk authentication was active but no advisor profile existed in the database

### The Solutions Applied:
1. **API Fix**: Implemented full database save logic in `/api/onboarding/complete/route.ts`
2. **Mock Hooks**: Created `/lib/mock/hooks.ts` for development that works with the mock database
3. **Dashboard Update**: Updated to use mock hooks instead of Supabase hooks

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Journey
1. Sign up ‚Üí Email verification ‚Üí Onboarding ‚Üí Dashboard
2. Expected: Smooth flow, profile saves, dashboard shows content

### Scenario 2: Existing User Without Profile

2. Expected: Profile saves, dashboard shows with user data

### Scenario 3: Existing User With Profile

2. Expected: Dashboard shows with saved profile data

## üîß Troubleshooting

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure all required fields are filled:
   - Full Name
   - Phone Number  
   - Business Name
   - City
   - State

### If dashboard is empty:
