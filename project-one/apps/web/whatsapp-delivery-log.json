    "text": "*Hello Shriya Vallabh,*  \n\nI hope you're doing well! This is [Your Name], your financial advisor.  \n\nAs we approach 2025, it’s essential to adopt smart investment strategies. A great option is to start a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) in mutual funds. SIPs allow you to invest a fixed amount regularly, which helps in averaging out costs and reducing market volatility risks.  \n\n*Consider this:* If you invest ₹5,000 monthly in a mutual fund with an expected return of 12% per annum, after 5 years, you could accumulate approximately ₹3.8 lakhs!  \n\nAlways remember, investments are subject to market risks. Please read all scheme-related documents carefully before investing.  \n\n*EUIN: E243438*  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Contact Information]",
