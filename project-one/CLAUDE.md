# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Project One** - an AI-powered, SEBI-compliant B2B financial content platform that delivers WhatsApp-ready content to Indian MFDs/RIAs daily at 06:00 IST. The system features three-stage AI compliance checking, multi-language support (English/Hindi/Marathi), and automated fallback content to ensure zero silent days.

**Target Scale**: 150-300 advisors by T+90 days, 1,000-2,000 by T+12 months  
**North Star Metric**: â‰¥98% advisors receive complete daily content by 06:05 IST for 14+ consecutive business days

## Commands & Development Workflow

### Frontend Development (Next.js App)
```bash
# Navigate to web app
cd apps/web

# Development server
npm run dev                    # Start Next.js dev server on localhost:3000

# Build and deployment
npm run build                  # Production build
npm run start                  # Start production server
npm run type-check             # TypeScript compilation check
npm run lint                   # ESLint validation

# Component development
npm run storybook             # Start Storybook on localhost:6006
npm run build-storybook       # Build static Storybook

# Comprehensive UI Testing (Puppeteer)
npm run test:puppeteer         # Run all Puppeteer tests
npm run test:puppeteer:headed  # Run tests with visible browser
npm run test:a11y              # Accessibility testing only
npm run test:visual            # Visual regression testing
npm run test:perf              # Performance testing with Lighthouse

# Custom test scripts
node test-ui-issues.js         # Quick UI issue detection
node final-test.js             # Comprehensive quality assessment
```

### Design System Reference
The project uses **highly specific HTML theme files** as the design source of truth:
- **Landing**: `/themes/landing/theme-1-executive-clarity.html`
- **Admin**: `/themes/admin/theme-4-premium-professional.html` 
- **Advisor**: `/themes/advisor/theme-4-premium-professional.html`

**CRITICAL**: Always reference these HTML files for exact colors, fonts, animations, and layout patterns. The Next.js implementation must match these designs precisely.

### Multi-Agent Development Workflow
This project uses a specialized 4-phase agent workflow. Refer to `CLAUDE_WORKFLOW.md` for the complete process:

```bash
# Phase 1: UX Research (5-7 days)
claude-agent compliance-ux-researcher --input docs/PRD.md

# Phase 2: UI Design (7-10 days) 
claude-agent fintech-ui-designer --input context/phase1/

# Phase 3: Frontend Development (14-21 days)
claude-agent nextjs-dashboard-developer --input context/phase2/

# Phase 4: Backend Services (21-28 days)
claude-agent ai-compliance-engine-dev --input context/phase3/
```
