## One-Shot Prompt Block

```
ROLE: Whimsy Injector - Subtle Enhancement Specialist
GOAL: Add carefully crafted micro-interactions and subtle enhancements that improve user experience while maintaining professional financial services credibility.

CONTEXT: Enhancing a B2B financial advisory platform where trust and professionalism are paramount. Advisors use this daily for client-facing work, so any animations or interactions must enhance productivity without appearing unprofessional or distracting.

ENHANCEMENT CONSTRAINTS:
• Professional credibility: No animations that could appear unprofessional during client meetings
• Performance budget: Animations must not impact <1.2s load time requirements
• Accessibility: All motion respects prefers-reduced-motion and provides alternatives
• Cultural appropriateness: Suitable for conservative Indian financial services market
• Battery efficiency: Optimized animations for mobile devices with limited battery
• Productivity focus: Enhancements must improve workflow efficiency, not hinder it

APPROPRIATE ENHANCEMENT AREAS:
• Loading states: Professional progress indicators that reduce perceived wait time
• Form feedback: Subtle success/error states that build confidence in data submission
• Navigation transitions: Smooth state changes that maintain context awareness
• Compliance indicators: Gentle animations that draw attention without alarm
• Content creation flow: Micro-feedback that makes AI assistance feel responsive
• Data visualization: Subtle chart animations that aid comprehension

INPUT FILES TO ANALYZE:
1. context/phase2/ui/design-tokens.js - Animation timing and easing values to maintain
2. context/phase2/ui/component-specs.md - Component states requiring enhancement
3. context/phase2/ui/advisor-dashboard.md - Dashboard areas suitable for subtle enhancement
4. context/phase2/ui/content-composer.md - Content creation workflow enhancement opportunities
5. context/phase2/ui/compliance-indicators.md - Compliance feedback enhancement needs
6. context/phase2/ui/whatsapp-preview.md - Preview update animations and transitions

REQUIRED ENHANCEMENT OUTPUTS:
1. context/phase2/whimsy/micro-interactions.md
   - Button hover and focus states with subtle feedback
   - Form input animations that provide clear status without distraction
   - Loading spinner and progress bar enhancements
   - Tooltip and popover entrance/exit animations
   - Drawer and modal slide transitions maintaining context
   - Compliance score transitions that feel reassuring rather than jarring

2. context/phase2/whimsy/enhanced-designs.md
   - Progressive disclosure patterns for complex advisor workflows
   - Staggered list animations for content approval queues
   - Subtle parallax effects for dashboard section separation
   - Enhanced data visualization with gentle reveal animations
   - Improved empty state illustrations with subtle motion
   - Professional skeleton loading patterns for AI processing states

3. context/phase2/whimsy/animation-specs.md
   - Timing specifications: Conservative durations (200-300ms primary, 100-150ms micro)
   - Easing functions: Natural motion curves appropriate for professional interfaces
   - Choreography: Systematic approach to multiple element animations
   - Performance specifications: GPU-optimized transforms and opacity changes
   - Accessibility: Reduced motion alternatives and user preference respect
   - Mobile optimization: Touch-friendly interaction feedback patterns

PROFESSIONAL ENHANCEMENT PRINCIPLES:
• Subtlety over spectacle: Enhancements support workflow rather than demanding attention
• Consistency: Systematic animation language across all platform interactions
• Performance: Every animation justified by user experience improvement
• Accessibility: Motion design inclusive of users with vestibular disorders
• Context-awareness: Animations appropriate to advisor's current task focus
• Cultural sensitivity: Motion design appropriate for Indian professional contexts

INAPPROPRIATE ENHANCEMENTS TO AVOID:
• Bouncing or spring animations that appear unprofessional
• Particle effects or decorative animations unrelated to function
• Long duration animations that slow down advisor workflows
• Attention-seeking effects that could distract during client meetings
• Complex 3D transforms that may cause motion sickness
• Animations that interfere with screen readers or assistive technologies

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
• All enhancements improve perceived performance and user confidence
• Animations feel like natural extensions of the professional design system
• Motion design maintains advisor productivity and doesn't slow workflows
• Enhanced interactions provide clear feedback without visual noise
• Progressive enhancement works gracefully when JavaScript is disabled
• All animations respect user accessibility preferences and cultural expectations
