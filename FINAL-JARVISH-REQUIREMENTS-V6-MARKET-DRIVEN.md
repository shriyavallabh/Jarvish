      marketIntelligence: await this.realTimeMarketAnalysis(),
      clientSegment: await this.analyzeTargetAudience(context),
      complianceRules: await this.fetchDynamicSEBIRules(),
      performanceHistory: await this.getHistoricalEngagement(context.advisorId),
      optimization: 'engagement_compliance_balance'
    });
    
    return await this.validateAndPersonalize(content, context);
  }
}
```

#### **2. Semantic Compliance Engine**
```javascript
// AI-powered SEBI compliance interpretation
class SemanticComplianceEngine {
  async checkCompliance(content, context) {
    const analysis = await this.aiService.analyze({

      regulations: await this.fetchLatestSEBICirculars(),
      advisorType: context.advisorProfile.type, // MFD vs RIA
      contentContext: {
        platform: 'whatsapp',
        audience: context.targetSegment,
        contentType: await this.classifyContent(content)
      },
      instruction: `
        Perform contextual SEBI compliance analysis:
        1. Identify regulatory violations with specific rule references
        2. Assess cultural and linguistic appropriateness
        3. Evaluate investment advice vs education distinction
        4. Check mandatory disclosures and risk warnings
        5. Suggest improvements maintaining message intent
      `
    });
    
    return this.interpretComplianceResults(analysis);
  }
}
```

#### **3. Adaptive Research System**
```javascript
// Self-improving research automation
class IntelligentResearchSystem {
  async discoverAndValidateSources() {
    const newSources = await this.aiService.discover({
      query: 'reliable financial news sources India 2025',
      criteria: [
        'regulatory_compliance',
        'update_frequency', 
        'accuracy_track_record',
        'market_coverage_depth'
      ]
    });
    
    // AI evaluates and onboards new sources automatically
    for (const source of newSources) {
      const credibility = await this.aiService.evaluateCredibility(source);
      if (credibility.score > 0.8) {
