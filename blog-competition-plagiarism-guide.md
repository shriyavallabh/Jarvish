## Understanding Plagiarism in Blog Competitions {#understanding-plagiarism}

### What Constitutes Plagiarism
- **Direct Copying**: Using someone else's exact words without quotation marks and attribution
- **Paraphrasing Without Credit**: Rewording someone's ideas without citing the source
- **Self-Plagiarism**: Reusing your own previously published work without disclosure
- **Mosaic Plagiarism**: Combining phrases from multiple sources without attribution
- **AI-Generated Content Without Disclosure**: Presenting AI output as entirely your own work

### Competition-Specific Considerations
- Most competitions require 100% original content
- Some allow limited quotes with proper attribution (check rules)
- AI assistance policies vary - always check competition guidelines
- Disclosure requirements may be mandatory

---

## Using AI Assistance Ethically {#using-ai-ethically}

```

I want to develop my own original ideas, so please provide:
- Questions to consider
