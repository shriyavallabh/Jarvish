# ðŸ”Š SOUND NOTIFICATION FIX

## The Problem
The automatic sound hooks aren't triggering in new terminals, likely due to zsh configuration conflicts or audio routing issues on macOS.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Solution 1: Manual Sound Commands (Works NOW)
```bash
# Play sound manually after any command
your-command; afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff

# Example:
npm install; afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
```

### Solution 2: Use the notify function (Works NOW)
```bash
# This wraps any command with sound
notify sleep 5
notify npm install
notify npm run build
```

### Solution 3: Chain commands with && 
```bash
sleep 5 && afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
npm install && afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
```

### Solution 4: Use semicolon for sound regardless of success
```bash
npm install; ding
sleep 5; ding
```

## TO ACTIVATE IN CURRENT TERMINAL

Run this command to activate sounds for the current session:
```bash
source ~/Desktop/Jarvish/scripts/shell-sound-hook.sh
```

Then test with:
```bash
sleep 4  # Should play sound after 4 seconds
```

## PERMANENT FIX OPTIONS

### Option A: Add to .zshrc manually
```bash
echo 'source ~/Desktop/Jarvish/scripts/shell-sound-hook.sh' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Option B: Use bash instead of zsh
```bash
bash
source ~/Desktop/Jarvish/scripts/shell-sound-hook.sh
```

### Option C: Create a custom terminal profile
1. Open Terminal â†’ Preferences
2. Create new profile
3. Set startup command: `source ~/Desktop/Jarvish/scripts/shell-sound-hook.sh`

## DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

1. **Check audio is working:**
   ```bash
   afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
   ```

2. **Check volume:**
   ```bash
   osascript -e "get volume settings"
   ```

3. **Test text-to-speech:**
   ```bash
   say "Testing audio"
   ```

4. **Check if hooks are loaded:**
   ```bash
   echo $TASK_SOUND_ENABLED
   ```

## WORKING ALIASES

These are already in your .zshrc:
- `sound` - plays Glass sound
- `beep` - plays Ping sound  
- `alert` - plays Hero sound
- `error` - plays Basso sound
- `notify <command>` - runs command with sound

## THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION

Just append `; ding` or `; sound` to any command:
```bash
npm install; ding
sleep 5; sound
npm run build; alert
```

Or use the notify wrapper:
```bash
notify npm install
notify sleep 5
```

This will DEFINITELY work!
