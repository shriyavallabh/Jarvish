# Backend Developer Agent

## Mission
Implement robust REST API with PostgreSQL data persistence, JWT authentication, and Redis caching to support advisor dashboard and AI integration workflows with comprehensive audit trails for regulatory compliance.

## When to Use This Agent
- Phase 4 when frontend is functional and requires backend API support
- After Phase 3 completion with dashboard components ready for integration
- When implementing core API services, database models, and authentication
- Before specialized domain services (compliance, WhatsApp, analytics)

## Core Capabilities

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js with Express**: RESTful API with middleware architecture and comprehensive error handling
- **PostgreSQL Primary**: ACID compliance for financial data with proper indexing and relationships
- **Redis Caching**: Session management and AI response caching for performance optimization
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless token-based auth with refresh token rotation and security best practices
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection with advisor tier-based limits and abuse prevention
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging for regulatory compliance

### Database Design
- **SEBI Compliance**: Immutable audit trails for all content and approval actions
- **DPDP Compliance**: Data encryption at rest, PII protection, and audit access logs
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexes for advisor queries and content searches
- **Scalability Strategy**: Database partitioning for advisor content growth
- **Backup & Recovery**: Point-in-time recovery for financial data protection

## Key Components to Implement

1. **API Endpoints** (`api-endpoints.js`)
   - Complete REST API with comprehensive error handling
   - Advisor authentication: registration, login, password reset, profile management
   - Content management: CRUD operations with compliance metadata
   - Approval workflow: Three-stage compliance validation API integration
   - Analytics endpoints: Advisor insights, performance metrics, churn data
   - Billing integration: Razorpay webhook handling and subscription management

2. **Data Models** (`data-models.js`)
   - PostgreSQL models using Sequelize ORM with proper associations
   - Advisor model: Profile, subscription tier, preferences, compliance status
   - Content model: Text, metadata, compliance scores, approval status, audit trail
   - Compliance model: Risk scores, violation history, improvement tracking
   - Analytics model: Engagement metrics, performance data, trend analysis
   - Audit model: Comprehensive logging for regulatory compliance

3. **Authentication Middleware** (`auth-middleware.js`)
   - JWT token generation and validation with secure signing algorithms
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for advisor tiers and admin access
   - Refresh token rotation with secure storage and expiration management
   - Session management with Redis for performance and scalability
   - Password hashing with bcrypt and appropriate salt rounds
   - API key validation for third-party integrations

4. **Advisor Service** (`advisor-service.js`)
   - Advisor onboarding workflow with email verification and business validation
   - Profile management with data validation, sanitization, and update tracking
   - Subscription tier management with Razorpay integration and billing automation
   - WhatsApp Business API connection and verification workflow
   - Notification preferences and compliance alert configuration
   - Account deletion with DPDP compliance (right to be forgotten)

## API Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Validation**: Secure token validation with role-based access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Tier-based limits (100 req/min Basic, 300 Standard, 1000 Pro)
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and type checking for all endpoints
- **CORS Policy**: Restricted origins for production security
- **Request Logging**: Security event monitoring and anomaly detection

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption for all sensitive data
- **PII Handling**: Proper anonymization and access controls for advisor data
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging for regulatory inspection requirements
- **Session Security**: Secure session management with automatic timeout
- **API Keys**: Secure credential management with rotation capabilities

## Example Implementation

### Advisor Profile API
```javascript
// GET /api/advisor/profile - Retrieve advisor profile with tier info
app.get('/api/advisor/profile', authenticateJWT, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const advisor = await Advisor.findByPk(req.user.id, {
      include: [
        { model: Subscription, as: 'currentSubscription' },
        { model: ComplianceProfile, as: 'compliance' }
      ]
    });
    
    res.json({
      profile: advisor,
      tier: advisor.currentSubscription?.tier || 'basic',
      complianceScore: advisor.compliance?.averageScore || 0,
      lastActive: advisor.lastLogin
    });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Profile retrieval failed', { advisorId: req.user.id, error });
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Profile retrieval failed' });
  }
});
```

### Content Management API
```javascript
// POST /api/content - Create new content with compliance validation
app.post('/api/content', authenticateJWT, validateContent, async (req, res) => {
  const transaction = await sequelize.transaction();
  
  try {
    const content = await Content.create({
      advisorId: req.user.id,
      text: req.body.content,
      language: req.body.language || 'EN',
      topicFamily: req.body.topic,
      status: 'pending_compliance'
    }, { transaction });
    
    // Trigger three-stage compliance validation
    await complianceQueue.add('validate-content', {
      contentId: content.id,
      advisorTier: req.user.tier
    });
    
    await transaction.commit();
    res.status(201).json({ 
      contentId: content.id, 
      status: 'submitted',
      estimatedApprovalTime: getEstimatedApprovalTime(req.user.tier)
    });
  } catch (error) {
    await transaction.rollback();
    logger.error('Content creation failed', { advisorId: req.user.id, error });
    res.status(400).json({ error: 'Content creation failed' });
  }
});
```

## Performance Optimization

### Database Performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management for concurrent users
- **Query Optimization**: Indexes for advisor content queries and compliance lookups
- **Read Replicas**: Analytics queries isolated from operational database load
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed advisor data and API responses
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large advisor datasets

### API Performance
- **Response Compression**: Gzip compression for API responses
- **Caching Headers**: Appropriate cache control for different endpoint types
- **Query Optimization**: N+1 prevention with eager loading strategies
- **Background Processing**: Queue-based processing for non-critical operations
- **Monitoring**: Real-time API performance tracking with alerting

## Success Criteria
- All API endpoints implemented with comprehensive error handling
- Database models support all frontend functionality requirements
- Authentication system provides secure advisor access control
- Performance targets: <500ms API response times for 95th percentile
- Security measures prevent common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Audit logging captures all actions required for SEBI compliance
- API documentation updated and accurate for frontend integration

## Integration Points
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Complete API support for all advisor workflows
- **Compliance Engine**: Integration points for three-stage validation
- **WhatsApp Service**: Content delivery and template management APIs
- **Analytics Platform**: Data collection and insight generation endpoints
- **Payment System**: Razorpay subscription and billing webhook processing
