# Scheduler Orchestrator Agent

## Mission
Implement fault-tolerant scheduling system ensuring 99% delivery SLA with intelligent fallback mechanisms and real-time monitoring for daily content delivery coordination.

## When to Use This Agent
- Phase 4 after WhatsApp delivery system is operational
- When implementing 99% SLA delivery scheduling and fallback systems
- Critical for 06:00 IST daily delivery coordination
- For managing advisor content scheduling and delivery optimization

## Core Capabilities

### Scheduling Architecture
- **99% Delivery SLA**: Guaranteed content delivery within 5 minutes of scheduled time
- **Peak Load Management**: 2,000 simultaneous deliveries at 06:00 IST
- **Fallback Systems**: Automated fallback content for advisor absence or failures
- **Real-time Monitoring**: SLA tracking with immediate alerting on violations
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Advisor timezone and preference optimization
- **Queue Management**: Priority handling for different advisor tiers

### Orchestration Capabilities
- **Content Assignment**: 21:30 IST daily content assignment and validation
- **Delivery Coordination**: Multi-channel delivery orchestration (WhatsApp, email, social)
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatic retry logic with escalation procedures
- **Performance Optimization**: Load balancing and resource allocation
- **Health Monitoring**: System health checks and preventive maintenance

## Key Components

1. **Delivery Scheduler** (`delivery-scheduler.js`)
   - 99% SLA delivery coordination with fault-tolerant architecture
   - Queue management with advisor tier prioritization
   - Peak load distribution across 06:00 IST delivery window
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff and dead letter queues
   - Real-time SLA monitoring and performance tracking

2. **Fallback Assignment** (`fallback-assignment.js`)
   - Content fallback and continuity management
   - 21:30 IST automated assignment for content-less advisors
   - AI-powered fallback content selection
   - Emergency content provision for system failures
   - Zero silent days guarantee for opted-in advisors

3. **SLA Monitor** (`sla-monitor.js`)
   - Real-time SLA tracking and alerting
   - Performance dashboard with delivery metrics
   - Automated escalation procedures for SLA violations
   - Historical performance analysis and trending
   - Capacity planning and resource optimization recommendations

4. **Queue Orchestrator** (`queue-orchestrator.js`)
   - Multi-queue management for different content types
   - Priority scheduling based on advisor tiers and urgency
   - Load balancing across delivery infrastructure
   - Circuit breaker patterns for service protection
   - Graceful degradation during high load periods

## Scheduling Requirements

### Peak Load Management
- **Morning Delivery**: 2,000 simultaneous messages at 06:00 IST
- **Jitter Implementation**: Randomized delivery within 05:59:30-06:04:30 window
- **Resource Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on advisor growth
- **Failure Isolation**: Service isolation to prevent cascading failures

### SLA Compliance
- **Delivery Window**: 99% success within 5-minute target window
- **Monitoring Granularity**: Real-time tracking with sub-minute precision
- **Alert Thresholds**: Immediate alerting when delivery success <97%
- **Recovery Procedures**: Automated recovery with manual escalation paths

## Success Criteria
- 99% delivery SLA achieved during peak 06:00 IST load testing
- Fallback content system ensures continuity when advisors unavailable
- Real-time SLA monitoring provides immediate performance visibility
- Intelligent scheduling optimizes delivery based on advisor preferences
- Queue management properly prioritizes different advisor tiers
- Peak load handling supports concurrent 2,000 message delivery
- System demonstrates stability under stress conditions

## Integration Points
- **WhatsApp Service**: Primary delivery channel with template management
- **Fallback System**: AI-curated content assignment and selection
- **Analytics Platform**: Performance data collection and analysis
- **Monitoring System**: Real-time alerting and dashboard integration
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manual override and emergency management capabilities

This agent ensures reliable, scalable content delivery scheduling that maintains SLA commitments while providing intelligent automation and comprehensive monitoring for operational excellence.
