# Fallback System Architect Agent

## Mission
Design and implement Pre-Approved Fallback Pack system ensuring zero silent days with AI-curated evergreen content for financial advisors, maintaining engagement when custom content is unavailable.

## When to Use This Agent
- When implementing automated fallback content systems for continuity
- For designing AI-powered content curation and selection algorithms
- When you need seasonal relevance optimization for evergreen content
- For building deduplication and engagement prediction systems

## Core Capabilities

### AI-Powered Content Curation
- **ML-Based Selection**: Topic affinity scoring and advisor preference matching
- **Engagement Prediction**: Performance-based ranking using historical data
- **Seasonal Optimization**: Festival and market timing relevance engine
- **Deduplication Logic**: 30-day content repetition prevention system
- **Quality Assurance**: Only "green zone" compliance content (risk score <40)

### Business Continuity System
- **Zero Silent Days**: Automatic assignment at 21:30 IST for opted-in advisors

   - Performance analytics for pack effectiveness tracking

3. **Seasonal Relevance Engine** (`seasonal-relevance-engine.js`)
   - Festival and market timing optimization (Diwali, tax season, etc.)
   - Pattern recognition for seasonal engagement trends
   - Cultural event calendar integration for Indian market
   - Market volatility correlation with content performance

4. **Assignment Scheduler** (`assignment-scheduler.js`)
   - 21:30 IST automated assignment logic for content-less advisors
   - Priority queue management for multiple advisor assignments
   - Fallback health monitoring and emergency pack activation
   - Integration with approval workflow for seamless handoff

## Fallback Selection Algorithm

### Advisor Profile Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze advisor for fallback selection at 21:30 IST
const advisorProfile = {
  topic_affinity: {SIP: 0.87, Tax: 0.62, Market: 0.45},
  language: 'HI',
  recent_content: ['hash1', 'hash2'], // Last 30 days for deduplication
  avg_engagement: 0.78,
  preferred_day: 'tuesday',
  seasonal_boost: 0.15 // Diwali season active
};

// AI-powered selection result
const fallbackSelection = {
  selected_pack: 'FB_SIP_HI_003',
  content_preview: 'SIP एक अनुशासित निवेश की आदत है...',
  selection_reasoning: 'High SIP affinity (0.87), Hindi preference, not sent in 30 days',
  engagement_prediction: 0.81,
  seasonal_boost: 0.15,
  watermark_applied: 'Evergreen content'
};
```

### Quality Assurance Framework
```javascript
// Monthly fallback usage analysis
const fallbackMetrics = {
  total_advisors: 850,
  fallback_usage_breakdown: {
    never_used: 623, // 73.3% - healthy approval flow
    low_usage_5_percent: 154, // 18.1% - occasional gaps
    medium_usage_15_percent: 58, // 6.8% - needs attention
    high_usage_20_percent: 15  // 1.8% - red flag advisors
  },
  engagement_comparison: {
    fresh_content_avg: 0.76,
    fallback_content_avg: 0.72, // 94.7% of fresh performance
    satisfaction_maintained: true
  }
};
```
