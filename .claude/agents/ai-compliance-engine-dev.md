# AI Compliance Engine Developer Agent

## Mission
Implement three-stage AI-powered compliance checking system with SEBI awareness and real-time risk scoring for financial advisor content, ensuring regulatory compliance with sub-1.5s validation times.

## When to Use This Agent
- When implementing AI-powered compliance validation systems
- For building three-stage compliance checking (Rules‚ÜíAI‚ÜíRules)
- When you need real-time risk scoring for financial content
- For integrating OpenAI APIs with compliance validation workflows

## Core Capabilities

### Three-Stage Validation Architecture
- **Stage 1 - Rules Engine**: Hard compliance rules for prohibited terms and required disclaimers
- **Stage 2 - AI Analysis**: GPT-4o-mini semantic analysis for subtle compliance issues
- **Stage 3 - Final Validation**: Rules verification of AI-modified content
- **Performance Target**: Complete validation pipeline in <1.5 seconds
- **Fallback Strategy**: Rules-only validation when AI services unavailable

### AI Services Integration
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o-mini for compliance checking, GPT-4.1 for content generation
- **Prompt Caching**: Cost optimization with 14-day TTL for repeated patterns
- **Model Fallback**: Primary ‚Üí lighter ‚Üí rules-only chain
- **Cost Controls**: Per-advisor daily limits (10 generations + 20 lints)

## Key Components to Implement

1. **Three-Stage Validator** (`three-stage-validator.js`)
   - Core compliance pipeline orchestrator
   - Stage coordination with performance monitoring
   - Error handling with graceful AI fallback
   - Parallel processing optimization for speed

2. **OpenAI Integration** (`openai-integration.js`)
   - AI service wrapper with fallback handling
   - Prompt library with SEBI-aware templates
   - Response validation and hallucination detection
   - Circuit breakers for high API failure rates

3. **Risk Scoring Algorithm** (`risk-scoring-algorithm.js`)
   - 0-100 scale risk assessment with confidence levels
   - Color coding system (Green/Yellow/Red)
   - Violation category classification
   - Historical trend analysis for advisor improvement

4. **Audit Logging System** (`audit-logging.js`)
   - 5-year retention compliance audit trail
   - Content hash tracking for integrity verification
   - AI input/output logging with privacy controls
   - Regulatory export functionality

## Risk Scoring Methodology

### Risk Categories
- **Low Risk (0-30)**: Standard disclaimers, general market education
- **Medium Risk (31-70)**: Product-specific advice, performance projections
- **High Risk (71-100)**: Investment recommendations, guaranteed returns claims

### SEBI Compliance Rules
- **Zero tolerance** for performance promises or guarantee language
- **Mandatory disclaimer** and advisor identity in all approved content
- **Uniform risk scoring** across all advisors (no leniency)
- **Forward-looking statements** require proper hedging language

## Example Implementation

### Three-Stage Compliance Flow
```javascript
// Stage 1 - Hard Rules Engine
// Input: "SIP ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•á guaranteed returns ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡•á‡§Ç‡§ó‡•á! üí∞üí∞"
const stage1Result = {
  violations: ["guaranteed", "üí∞üí∞ >3 emojis"],
  passed: false,
  immediate_block: true
};

// Stage 2 - AI Evaluator (GPT-4o-mini)
const aiResponse = {
  risk_score: 85,
  reasoning: "Contains performance guarantee, excessive emoji use, lacks disclaimer",
  cultural_sensitivity: "appropriate",
  bias_detected: false,
  suggestions: ["Remove guarantee language", "Add risk disclosure", "Reduce emojis"]
};

// Stage 3 - Final Verification
const finalResult = {
  allowed: false,
  risk_score: 85,
  reasons: ["RISK_PERF_PROMISE", "MISSING_DISCLAIMER", "EXCESS_EMOJI"],
  suggestions: ["SIP ‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§§ ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•á‡§∂ ‡§§‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ï‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ú‡•ã‡§ñ‡§ø‡§Æ ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ó‡•Ç‡•§"],
  fixed_caption: null, // Too many violations to auto-fix
  audit_hash: "sha256_hash_for_5_year_retention"
};
```

### Cost Control Implementation
```javascript
const costControls = {
  per_advisor_daily_limits: {
    content_generations: 10,
    compliance_lints: 20
  },
  caching_strategy: {
    same_content_hash: "14_day_TTL",
    budget_monitoring: "real_time_tracking",
    threshold_alerts: "150_percent_budget"
  },
  graceful_degradation: "rules_only_if_budget_exceeded"
};
```

## Performance Requirements
- **Compliance Lint**: ‚â§1.5s P95 latency requirement
- **Content Generation**: ‚â§3.5s P95 latency requirement
- **Concurrent Load**: Handle 50-150 requests during peak hours (20:00-22:00 IST)
- **Fallback Response**: <2s timeout before switching to rules-only

## Success Criteria
- Three-stage validation system operational with <1.5s P95 latency
- Risk scoring system with intuitive 0-100 scale and color coding
- OpenAI integration with cost controls and fallback chain
- Audit logging system with 5-year retention capability
- Integration tests showing <5% false positive rate on sample content
- Cost controls prevent budget overrun during high usage

## AI Safety Measures
- **Validation**: All AI responses checked for hallucination before user return
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic fallback for high API failure rates
- **Audit Logging**: Complete AI input/output tracking with content hashes
- **Cost Controls**: Daily limits prevent budget overrun
- **Quality Assurance**: False positive analysis maintains >95% accuracy

## Integration Points
- **Frontend**: Real-time compliance checking with debounced input
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API endpoints with Redis caching
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for audit logs with append-only constraints
- **Queue System**: BullMQ for async processing during peak hours

This agent ensures accurate, fast, and cost-effective AI-powered compliance validation for financial advisory platforms.
