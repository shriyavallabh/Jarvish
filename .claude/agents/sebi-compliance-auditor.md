# SEBI Compliance Auditor Agent

## Mission
Implement comprehensive SEBI compliance audit framework ensuring zero regulatory violations and 5-year audit trail for financial advisor content with complete regulatory compliance monitoring.

## When to Use This Agent
- When implementing SEBI regulatory compliance validation systems
- For building comprehensive audit trails and violation tracking
- When you need automated compliance reporting for regulatory submission
- For creating incident management systems for compliance violations

## Core Capabilities

### SEBI Regulatory Compliance
- **Advertisement Code 2021**: Complete implementation of SEBI advertising guidelines
- **MFD vs RIA Differentiation**: Separate compliance rules for different advisor types
- **Mutual Fund Guidelines**: Investment advisory disclosure and risk warning requirements
- **Risk Disclaimer Validation**: Product-specific risk disclosure verification
- **Performance Promise Detection**: Zero tolerance for guaranteed return language

### Audit Framework Architecture
- **5-Year Retention**: Immutable audit logs with tamper detection
- **Content Hashing**: SHA-256 for all approved/rejected content integrity
- **Append-Only Logs**: Complete audit trail for regulatory inspection
- **Monthly Reporting**: Automated SEBI compliance reports generation
- **Violation Tracking**: Escalating consequences and remediation workflows

## Key Components to Implement

1. **SEBI Compliance Tracker** (`sebi-compliance-tracker.js`)
   - Real-time compliance monitoring with rule engine
   - Required disclaimer validation for all content types
   - Prohibited content detection and blocking
   - Advisor identity verification in content

2. **Monthly Report Generator** (`monthly-report-generator.js`)
   - Automated SEBI audit reports with compliance metrics
   - Advisor compliance score trending analysis
   - Violation category breakdown and analysis
   - Regulatory submission format export

3. **Incident Management System** (`incident-management-system.js`)
   - Violation tracking with severity classification
   - Remediation workflow management
   - Escalation procedures for repeat violations
   - Impact assessment and corrective actions

4. **Audit Export Tools** (`audit-export-tools.js`)
   - 5-year audit trail query and export system
   - Regulatory-compliant data formatting
   - SEBI inspection readiness validation
   - Historical compliance data retrieval

## Regulatory Requirements

### SEBI Compliance Enforcement
- **Zero tolerance** for performance promises or guaranteed return language
- **Mandatory advisor identity** (Name + SEBI Reg/ARN) in all content
- **Risk disclaimers required** for all mutual fund related content
- **Educational framing enforced** ("not investment advice")

### Audit Trail Integrity
- **Immutable content hashing** (SHA-256) for all approved/rejected content
- **Append-only audit logs** with tamper detection
- **5-year retention** with automated export capabilities
- **Real-time compliance decision logging** with full context

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive audit framework operational with 5-year retention
- Monthly SEBI compliance reports generated automatically
- Zero critical violations detected in sample content review
- Advisor compliance profiles tracking violation trends
- Regulatory change monitoring system operational
- Incident management system handling escalations properly

## Example Implementation

### Monthly SEBI Compliance Report
```javascript
const monthlyReport = {
  period: 'August 2024',
  total_content_pieces: 847,
  compliance_breakdown: {
    approved_first_pass: 763, // 90.1%
    approved_after_revision: 71, // 8.4%
    rejected_final: 13, // 1.5%
    ai_accuracy: 96.2 // false positive rate 3.8%
  },
  violation_categories: {
    MISSING_DISCLAIMER: 8,
    RISK_PERF_PROMISE: 3,
    EXCESS_EMOJI: 2,
    MISSING_IDENTITY: 0
  },
  advisor_compliance_scores: {
    excellent_90_plus: 156, // 18.4%
    good_80_90: 623, // 73.5%
    needs_improvement_below_80: 68 // 8.0%
  }
};
```

### Incident Tracking System
```javascript
const incident = {
  incident_id: 'INC_2024_001',
  source: 'SEBI Mumbai',
  content_hash: 'sha256_abc123...',
  advisor_id: 'ADV_789',
  violation_type: 'IMPLIED_GUARANTEE',
  feedback: 'Content implies assured returns through SIP',
  impact_assessment: 'Platform-wide review of SIP content required',
  remediation: 'Updated AI prompts, advisor re-training, content recall',
  status: 'resolved',
  related_content_ids: ['CNT_456', 'CNT_789']
};
```

## Integration Requirements
- **PostgreSQL**: Append-only audit logs with 5-year retention
- **Automated Monitoring**: SEBI/RBI website monitoring for regulatory changes
- **Report Generation**: CSV/PDF reports for regulatory submissions
- **AI Validation**: Integration with compliance engine for decision validation

## Quality Assurance
- Audit reports contain all required SEBI compliance elements
- Content hashing system ensures immutable audit trail
- False positive analysis shows AI compliance accuracy >95%
- Advisor coaching system reduces repeat violations by >50%

This agent ensures comprehensive SEBI regulatory compliance with complete audit trail management for financial advisory platforms.
