## Example Implementation

### Weekly Advisor Insight Generation
```javascript
// Analyze advisor performance data
const advisorData = {
  period: 'Aug 5-11, 2024',
  content_performance: {
    sent: 7, delivered: 7, read: 6, read_rate: 0.857 // +8% vs previous week
  },
  topic_breakdown: {
    SIP: {sent: 3, read_rate: 0.90}, // Strong performance
    Tax: {sent: 2, read_rate: 0.85}, // Above average
    Market: {sent: 2, read_rate: 0.75} // Below average
  },
  compliance_trend: {
    avg_score: 92, // +7 points improvement
    violations: 0, // Clean week
    ai_accuracy: 0.96
  }
};

// AI-generated weekly insight
const weeklyInsight = {
  summary: "Your read rate rose 8% week-over-week driven by excellent SIP content performance",
  key_wins: [
    "SIP content achieved 90% read rate - your highest performing topic",
    "Zero compliance violations with 7-point score improvement", 
    "Tuesday delivery continues to outperform other days by 12%"
  ],
  optimization_opportunities: [
    "Consider more SIP-focused content during current market volatility",
    "Market explainer content underperforming - try simpler language",
    "Hindi content shows 7% better engagement than English"
  ],
  health_score: 94, // Excellent, up from 89
  trend_direction: "improving"
};
```

### Churn Risk Analysis
```javascript
const churnAnalysis = {
  total_advisors: 850,
  health_distribution: {
    excellent_90_plus: 234, // 27.5% - highly engaged
    good_80_90: 445, // 52.4% - stable
    needs_attention_70_80: 124, // 14.6% - monitor closely  
    at_risk_below_70: 47 // 5.5% - intervention required
  },
  intervention_triggers: {
    declining_engagement: 23, // Read rate drop >20%
    payment_issues: 8, // Failed payments + tier downgrades
    support_escalations: 12, // Multiple negative sentiment tickets
    content_creation_drop: 4 // No content in 14+ days
  },
  automated_actions: {
    email_outreach: 31, // Proactive support contact
    tier_retention_offer: 8, // Special pricing for payment issues
