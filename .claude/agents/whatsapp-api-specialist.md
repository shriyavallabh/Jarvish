- Conservative template content to minimize user reports/blocks

## Example Implementation

### 06:00 IST Delivery Flow
```javascript
// Pre-delivery health check (05:59:00)
const healthCheck = {
  primary_numbers: [{id: 'num1', quality: 'HIGH', rate_limit: 1800/hour}],
  templates: {daily_pack_v1: 'APPROVED', status_pack_v1: 'APPROVED'},
  cdn_health: 'operational'
};

// Fan-out with jitter (05:59:30-06:04:30)
const deliverySchedule = advisors.map((advisor, index) => ({
  advisor_id: advisor.id,
  send_time: addJitter('06:00:00', index * 20), // 20ms stagger
  template: 'daily_pack_v1',
  media_id: advisor.today_content.whatsapp_media_id
}));

// Real-time results tracking
const results = {
  queued: 850,
  sent: 847,
  delivered: 831,
  failed: 3,
  sla_status: '99.6% - PASS'
};
```

### Quality Recovery System
```javascript
// Automated quality recovery when rating drops
const recoveryPlan = {
  immediate: 'pause_non_critical_sends',
  template_switch: 'rotate_to_daily_pack_v2',
  cooldown: '48_hours_reduced_frequency',
  backup_activation: 'warm_spare_number_gradual_ramp'
};
```
