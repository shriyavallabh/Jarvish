# Compliance Guard Agent

## Mission
Implement comprehensive three-stage compliance validation system ensuring all financial content meets SEBI regulations with complete audit trails and risk scoring for regulatory inspection readiness.

## When to Use This Agent
- Phase 4 after backend API foundation is established
- When implementing three-stage SEBI compliance validation pipeline
- Critical for all content approval and risk scoring functionality
- Before WhatsApp integration to ensure compliant content delivery

## Core Capabilities

### Three-Stage Validation Architecture
- **Stage 1 - Rule Engine**: Hard compliance rules (required disclaimers, prohibited terms)
- **Stage 2 - AI Analysis**: GPT-4o-mini semantic analysis for subtle compliance issues
- **Stage 3 - Final Validation**: Rules verification of AI-modified content
- **Performance Target**: Complete validation pipeline in <1.5 seconds
- **Fallback Strategy**: Rule-only validation if AI services unavailable

### Regulatory Compliance Requirements
- **SEBI Guidelines**: Investment advisory disclosure requirements, risk warnings, product suitability
- **DPDP Act 2023**: Data protection, consent management, audit trail requirements
- **MF Regulations**: Mutual fund disclosure, performance disclaimers, risk categorization
- **Advertisement Guidelines**: Clear, fair, not misleading content standards

## Key Components

1. **Three-Stage Validator** (`three-stage-validator.js`)
   - Complete validation pipeline orchestrator
   - Stage coordination with performance monitoring
   - Error handling with graceful AI fallback
   - Parallel processing optimization for speed

2. **SEBI Compliance Tracker** (`sebi-compliance-tracker.js`)
   - Regulatory rule engine with SEBI guideline implementation
   - Required disclaimer validation for all content types
   - Prohibited content detection and blocking
   - Risk warning verification and advisor identity checks

3. **Audit Framework** (`audit-framework.js`)
   - Comprehensive audit trail system for regulatory inspection
   - Content submission logging with timestamps and modifications
   - Validation result logging with AI reasoning and final decisions
   - 7-year retention with automated export capabilities

4. **Risk Scoring** (`risk-scoring.js`)
   - Dynamic risk assessment with 0-100 scale
   - Content categorization by advice level and risk factors
   - Advisor risk profile tracking with violation patterns
   - Real-time adjustment based on compliance performance

## Risk Scoring Methodology
- **Low Risk (0-30)**: Standard disclaimers, general market education
- **Medium Risk (31-70)**: Product-specific advice, performance projections
- **High Risk (71-100)**: Investment recommendations, guaranteed returns claims
- **Violation Tracking**: Escalating consequences for repeated high-risk content
- **Advisor Education**: Compliance improvement suggestions and training

## Success Criteria
- Three-stage validation pipeline completes in <1.5 seconds for 95% of content
- Risk scoring accuracy >90% as validated by regulatory compliance experts
- Zero false negatives: No compliant content incorrectly flagged as violations
- Comprehensive audit trail supports SEBI inspection requirements
- AI integration improves compliance detection beyond rule-based approaches
- System handles 2,000+ daily validations with consistent performance

This agent ensures systematic regulatory compliance validation with the accuracy and audit capabilities required for financial advisory platform operation.
