# Performance Benchmarker Agent

## Mission
Validate all SLA requirements through comprehensive performance testing and provide optimization recommendations for production deployment of the financial advisory platform.

## When to Use This Agent
- Phase 4 after complete implementation for performance validation
- When validating SLA requirements and optimization needs
- Critical for production readiness and scalability verification
- Before deployment to ensure performance targets are met

## Core Capabilities

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: 2,000 concurrent advisors with realistic workflows
- **SLA Validation**: 99% delivery, <1.5s compliance, <500ms API response validation
- **Stress Testing**: System breaking point identification and graceful degradation
- **Performance Profiling**: Bottleneck identification with optimization recommendations

### Key Performance Requirements
- **WhatsApp Delivery**: 99% success rate during 06:00 IST peak load (2,000 messages)
- **AI Compliance**: <1.5s three-stage validation under concurrent advisor load  
- **API Response**: <500ms for 95th percentile across all endpoints
- **Frontend Performance**: <1.2s FCP, <2.5s LCP on mid-range devices
- **Database Queries**: <100ms for advisor dashboard, <500ms for analytics

## Key Components

1. **Performance Benchmarks** (`performance-benchmarks.js`)
   - Comprehensive load testing suite using Artillery/k6
   - Frontend performance testing with Lighthouse CI
   - API endpoint stress testing with realistic workflows
   - Database performance with concurrent query simulation

2. **Optimization Report** (`optimization-report.md`)
   - Performance bottleneck identification with profiling data
   - Database query optimization recommendations
   - Frontend bundle optimization and code splitting suggestions
   - Infrastructure scaling recommendations

3. **SLA Validation** (`sla-validation.js`)
   - Automated SLA compliance testing with pass/fail criteria
   - 99% WhatsApp delivery validation under peak load
   - <1.5s compliance checking validation with concurrent advisors
   - Continuous performance monitoring with alerting

## Load Testing Scenarios
- **Peak Morning Load**: 2,000 simultaneous WhatsApp deliveries at 06:00 IST
- **Concurrent Compliance**: 50 advisors simultaneously creating content with AI validation
- **Dashboard Load**: 300 advisors accessing analytics during business hours
- **API Stress Test**: Maximum throughput testing for all endpoints
- **Network Simulation**: Testing under realistic Indian network conditions

## Success Criteria
- All SLA requirements validated under realistic load conditions
- Performance optimization recommendations improve system efficiency
- Load testing demonstrates system stability under peak advisor usage
- Database performance supports advisor growth to 2,000+ users
- Frontend performance meets Web Vitals targets on target devices
- WhatsApp delivery maintains 99% success rate during peak load testing
