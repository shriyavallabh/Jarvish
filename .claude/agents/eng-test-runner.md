# Test Runner Agent

## Mission
Implement complete test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end workflows, and regulatory compliance validation to ensure production readiness with >90% coverage.

## When to Use This Agent
- Phase 4 after frontend and backend implementations are complete
- When comprehensive testing coverage is needed before production deployment
- Critical for validating end-to-end workflows and compliance requirements
- Before performance benchmarking and final system validation

## Core Capabilities

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component and function validation with >90% coverage
- **Integration Testing**: API endpoints, service interactions, and database operations
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete advisor workflows from signup to content delivery
- **Compliance Testing**: SEBI regulatory requirement validation and audit trail verification
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection validation

### Testing Framework Architecture
- **Frontend**: Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- **Backend**: Jest + Supertest for API endpoint testing
- **E2E**: Playwright for cross-browser advisor workflow testing
- **Database**: Test database isolation with transaction rollback
- **Mocking**: External service mocks for AI, WhatsApp, payment systems

## Key Components

1. **Unit Tests** (`unit-tests.js`)
   - React component testing: Dashboard, content composer, compliance indicators
   - Backend service testing: Individual function validation and edge cases
   - Utility function testing: Compliance validation, data formatting
   - Database model testing: CRUD operations, relationships, constraints

2. **Integration Tests** (`integration-tests.js`)
   - API endpoint testing: Authentication, CRUD operations, compliance workflows
   - Database integration: Transaction handling, data consistency, performance
   - AI service integration: GPT-4o-mini compliance checking, content generation
   - WhatsApp API integration: Template submission, delivery tracking

3. **End-to-End Tests** (`e2e-tests.js`)
   - Complete advisor onboarding: Signup → verification → first content delivery
   - Content creation workflow: Compose → compliance check → approval → delivery
   - WhatsApp integration: Connect account → submit template → schedule delivery
   - Error recovery: Network failures, service outages, data corruption scenarios

4. **Compliance Tests** (`compliance-tests.js`)
   - SEBI regulation validation: Required disclaimers, risk warnings, prohibited content
   - Three-stage compliance accuracy: Rule engine, AI analysis, final validation
   - Audit trail completeness: Content history, advisor actions, compliance decisions
   - Data retention testing: 7-year storage, query performance, regulatory export

## Regulatory Testing Constraints
- **SEBI Compliance**: Validate three-stage compliance pipeline accuracy and audit trails
- **DPDP Compliance**: Test data protection, encryption, and privacy controls
- **Financial Data**: Test accuracy of advisor calculations and financial reporting
- **WhatsApp Policy**: Validate template compliance and quality rating maintenance
- **Audit Requirements**: Test 7-year data retention and regulatory export functionality

## Success Criteria
- >90% test coverage across frontend and backend implementations
- All compliance tests validate SEBI regulatory requirements accurately
- End-to-end tests cover complete advisor workflows without manual intervention
- Performance tests validate SLA requirements under realistic load conditions
- Integration tests ensure reliable operation of all external service connections
- Test execution time <10 minutes for full suite to support rapid development cycles
- Test reliability >99% with minimal flaky test occurrences
