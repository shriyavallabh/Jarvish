## Motion Design Principles Applied

### 1. Professional Financial Services Aesthetic
- **Timing**: Conservative durations (150-800ms) for trustworthy feel
- **Easing**: Professional cubic-bezier curves, minimal bounce effects
- **Colors**: Compliance-focused color coding (red→yellow→green)
- **Subtlety**: Purposeful animations that enhance rather than distract

### 2. SEBI Compliance Integration
- **Score Animations**: Count-up effects for compliance scores
- **Risk Indicators**: Color-coded pulsing for different risk levels
- **Approval Workflows**: Clear state transitions with checkmark draw-ins
- **Violation Alerts**: Attention-grabbing but professional warning animations

### 3. Accessibility-First Approach
- **Reduced Motion**: Comprehensive `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- **Alternative Feedback**: Color changes and opacity shifts for motion-sensitive users
- **ARIA Integration**: Live regions for dynamic content announcements
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order maintenance during animations

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **GPU Acceleration**: Transform and opacity properties only
- **Battery Awareness**: Reduced complexity on low battery
- **Frame Rate Targets**: 60fps standard, 30fps minimum with degradation
- **Memory Management**: Animation cleanup and efficient DOM manipulation

## Common Animation Patterns

### Page Load Sequences
```yaml
standard_load_pattern:
  duration: "800-1200ms"
  sequence:
    - header: "slide-down from top (0ms)"
    - main_content: "staggered appearance (200-400ms delay)"
    - secondary_elements: "fade-in (600-800ms delay)"
    - navigation: "slide-up from bottom (final)"
```

### Interactive Element States
```yaml
button_interactions:
  hover: "150-200ms professional ease"
  active: "100ms with scale feedback"
  loading: "400ms with spinner transition"
  success: "600ms with checkmark animation"
```

### Data Visualization
```yaml
metrics_animation:
  count_up: "800-1200ms confidence ease"
  progress_bars: "600-800ms with color transitions"
  trend_indicators: "400ms scale-in with bounce"
```

### Compliance Elements
```yaml
compliance_scoring:
  score_progression: "800-1200ms with color interpolation"
  violation_alerts: "400-600ms attention-grabbing pulse"
  approval_celebrations: "500-800ms subtle success animations"
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### CSS Properties Focus
- **Primary**: `transform`, `opacity` (GPU accelerated)
- **Secondary**: `color`, `background-color`, `border-color`
- **Avoid**: `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` (unless necessary)

### JavaScript Integration
- **Intersection Observer**: Trigger animations on scroll into view
- **Animation Queuing**: Prevent conflicting simultaneous animations
- **State Management**: Clean animation lifecycle management

### Testing Requirements
- **Cross-Platform**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
- **Mobile Performance**: iOS Safari, Android Chrome optimization
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility verification
- **Reduced Motion**: Complete functionality with animations disabled
