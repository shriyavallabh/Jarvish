## Design Rationale

### Layout Approach: **Grid Gallery View**
This variant organizes content as a visual grid gallery, emphasizing visual browsing and quick content identification through thumbnail previews.

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Visual-First Organization**
   - Thumbnail images for each content piece enable quick visual scanning
   - Grid layout maximizes content visibility in limited screen space
   - Visual status indicators (badges, colors) provide immediate feedback

2. **Comprehensive Filtering System**
   - Multi-dimensional filters (date, type, performance, tags) in sidebar
   - Quick filter tabs for common categories
   - Clear filter state with easy reset options

3. **Rich Content Metadata**
   - Each card shows essential metrics: engagement, compliance, delivery stats
   - Status badges clearly indicate content state
   - Performance indicators help identify successful content

4. **Action-Oriented Interface**
   - Context-specific actions on each card based on content state
   - Quick actions for common workflows (reuse, edit, share)
   - Bulk operations available through selection mode

5. **Progressive Loading**
   - Load more pattern prevents overwhelming initial view
   - Infinite scroll option for continuous browsing
   - Performance metrics shown for library management

### SEBI Compliance Features:
- Compliance scores prominently displayed on each content card
- Visual compliance status indicators
- Filter by compliance level for risk management
- Quick access to compliance review actions

### Accessibility Considerations:
- Grid layout maintains logical reading order
- High contrast status indicators
- Keyboard navigation through grid items
- Screen reader friendly metadata structure
