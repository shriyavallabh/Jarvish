## Design Rationale

### Layout Approach: **List-Priority Dashboard**
This variant organizes information as a prioritized task list, emphasizing time-sensitive actions and workflow completion.

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Time-Centric Organization**
   - Today's delivery status prominently featured with countdown
   - Timeline sidebar shows daily schedule and upcoming tasks
   - Priority actions ranked by urgency and impact

2. **Task-Oriented Interface**
   - Clear numbered priority list guides advisor workflow
   - Each task includes context, urgency indicators, and direct actions
   - Progressive disclosure from high-level status to detailed actions

3. **Contextual Information Architecture**
   - Current time and next delivery prominently displayed
   - Suggested actions based on AI recommendations
   - Status indicators show both current state and required actions

4. **Workflow-Driven Design**
   - Clear next steps for each priority item
   - Quick actions embedded in each task
   - One-click access to most common workflows

5. **Compact Information Display**
   - Stats condensed into single row for space efficiency
   - Essential metrics highlighted without overwhelming
   - Timeline gives temporal context to all activities

### SEBI Compliance Features:
- Compliance score visible in today's content status
- Pending content reviews highlighted as priority
- All content shows approval status before delivery
- Quick access to compliance checking tools

### Accessibility Considerations:
- Clear task numbering for screen readers
- High-contrast priority indicators
- Keyboard navigation through task list
- Time-based information clearly labeled
