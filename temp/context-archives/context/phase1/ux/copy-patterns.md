## Microcopy Patterns

### Navigation & Wayfinding
```yaml
navigation_copy:
  primary_menu:
    dashboard: "Dashboard" # not "Home" - implies business focus
    create: "Create Content" # clear action-oriented
    library: "My Content" # personal ownership
    analytics: "Performance" # business outcome focus
    settings: "Account Settings" # full context
    
  breadcrumbs:
    pattern: "Dashboard > Create Content > Topic Selection"
    separator: " > " # cleaner than "/"
    clickable_parents: "Dashboard and Create Content are links"
    
  page_titles:
    format: "{Action} | {Context} | Project One"
    examples:
      - "Create Content | Market Update | Project One"
      - "Approval Queue | 12 items pending | Project One"
      
  back_navigation:
    standard: "‚Üê Back to {Previous Page}"
    context_specific: "‚Üê Back to Content Creation"
    avoid: "‚Üê Back" # lacks context
```

### Form Labels & Instructions
```yaml
form_copy_patterns:
  field_labels:
    descriptive_clear: "Company Name (as it appears on your SEBI registration)"
    not_ambiguous: "Company Name" # too vague
    
  placeholder_text:
    helpful_examples: "e.g., Rajesh Kumar Financial Services"

    warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è This phone number is already registered. Use a different number or contact support."
    
  help_text:
    contextual: "Your SEBI registration number helps us ensure compliance for your content."
    action_oriented: "Don't have SEBI registration? Learn how to get one ‚Üí"
    progressive_disclosure: "Why do we need this? [expandable explanation]"
```

### Calls-to-Action (CTAs)
```yaml
cta_copy_patterns:
  primary_actions:
