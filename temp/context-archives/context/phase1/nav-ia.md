# Navigation & Information Architecture - Project One Financial Advisor Platform

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive navigation structure and information architecture for Project One's B2B financial advisor platform, ensuring intuitive user flows, efficient task completion, and seamless compliance workflow integration. The architecture prioritizes mobile-first design while supporting complex admin and advisor workflows.

## Information Architecture Principles

### Core IA Design Principles
```yaml
information_architecture_foundation:
  task_oriented_structure:
    principle: "organize content around advisor daily workflows and goals"
    implementation: "primary navigation reflects advisor task priorities"
    example: "create content, review performance, manage settings"
    
  compliance_first_hierarchy:
    principle: "surface compliance status and controls prominently"
    implementation: "compliance indicators visible on every content-related screen"
    example: "risk scores, approval status, sebi requirement alerts"
    
  progressive_disclosure:
    principle: "reveal complexity gradually based on user sophistication"
    implementation: "basic workflows visible by default, advanced features discoverable"
    example: "simple content creation with advanced editing available"
    
  contextual_relevance:
    principle: "show most relevant information for current task and time"
    implementation: "dynamic content based on advisor activity and schedule"
    example: "morning focus on today's delivery, evening on tomorrow's content"
    
  mobile_responsive_hierarchy:
    principle: "maintain usable information hierarchy across all screen sizes"
    implementation: "adaptive navigation preserving task flow on mobile devices"
    example: "bottom tab navigation with contextual sub-menus"
```
